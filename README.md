## _Free Music Archive Dataset_

### Notebooks

1. A notebook developed on Databricks
2. A notebook developed on Colab

### Two sets of data

For databricks the dataset was slightly modified to allow the import. That's why there is one folder with the Colab data and another one with the databricks data.
You can find the datasets with the link below:
